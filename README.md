Creating a GitHub README file for a repository that covers the theory of imbalanced and missing data, along with a Jupyter Notebook on how to handle these issues, involves outlining the purpose of the repository, the theoretical background, and practical guidance on dealing with these data challenges. Below is an example template you can use for your README file. Ensure you adapt and expand upon it based on the specific content and tools you use in your repository.

# Handling Imbalanced and Missing Data

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to exploring the theory behind imbalanced and missing data in machine learning datasets and providing practical solutions to deal with these issues. Through comprehensive Jupyter Notebooks, we demonstrate techniques and strategies to mitigate the impact of imbalanced and missing data on model performance.

## Contents
- **Theory**: A detailed explanation of what constitutes imbalanced and missing data, why it poses a problem for machine learning models, and the theoretical foundation for the methods used to address these issues.
- **Practical Guides**: Jupyter Notebooks that illustrate step-by-step processes for handling imbalanced and missing data, including code examples and explanations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `imbalanced-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

### Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/Naviden/Data-Quality-Issues.git
```
