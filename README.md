# Handling Imbalanced and Missing Data

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to exploring the theory behind imbalanced and missing data in machine learning datasets and providing practical solutions to deal with these issues. Through comprehensive Jupyter Notebooks, we demonstrate techniques and strategies to mitigate the impact of imbalanced and missing data on model performance.

## Contents
- **Theory**: A detailed explanation of what constitutes imbalanced and missing data, why it poses a problem for machine learning models, and the theoretical foundation for the methods used to address these issues.
- **Practical Guides**: Jupyter Notebooks that illustrate step-by-step processes for handling imbalanced and missing data, including code examples and explanations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `imbalanced-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- datasets: All datasets are publicly available but in case you don't want to search them manually, you can find all of them [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14Y_56VWmdn1OpYGDhdQSSKIo8iiZUJ8V?usp=sharing)
